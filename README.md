- **Material-UI**: Material-UI provides the design components and styles used in WorldWise, giving the application a sleek and modern look.

### Backend

- **json-server**: JSON Serve will serve its content in addition to the REST API.

### Build Tools

- **Vite**: A build tool for faster development.

- **ESLint**: For linting and maintaining code quality.

- **Prettier**: For code formatting.

## Design Patterns

- **Component-Based Architecture**: WorldWise follows a component-based architecture, where UI elements are broken down into reusable and modular components. This design pattern promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Container-Presentational Pattern**: WorldWise adopts the container-presentational pattern, separating container components (responsible for data fetching and state management) from presentational components (responsible for rendering UI elements). This separation of concerns enhances code readability and simplifies debugging.
